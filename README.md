ðŸ‘¶ A Python-based baby name generator that uses data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to generate baby names.

## Features

* Allows you to specify the of years (2023) to include in the data.
* Optionally generates a specified number of names.
* Includes error handling for invalid input and file issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-Jahbrill1/Baby-name-generator.git](https://github.com/your-Jahbrill1/Baby-Name-genertor.git)
2. Download the SSA data:

Go to the SSA website: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/
Download the yearly files (yobXXXX.txt) for the years you want to include.
Place the downloaded files in the data directory within the project folder

Run the script:

Bash

python baby_names.py  # Or the name of your main Python file
The script will prompt you for the start and end years.
It will then generate and print some random baby names.
Usage
The script currently generates a random selection of names.
You can modify the code to add more features like filtering by starting letter, generating a specific number of names, etc. (See the "Future Work" section below.)
Future Work
Add a command-line interface (CLI) for easier interaction.
Implement more filtering options (e.g., by starting letter, popularity, origin).
Create a web interface for a more user-friendly experience.
